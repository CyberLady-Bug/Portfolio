# About Me
My name is Monika Guzik-Skirzyńska.
I graduated from the Jagiellonian University with a master's degree in Polish studies: literary studies and grammar.
I also completed postgraduate studies at the University of Rzeszów, majoring in Music.
Recently, I started to be interested in software testing.
My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills related to the IT industry. I am also interested in programming.
On this page I would like to share all my experiences.
